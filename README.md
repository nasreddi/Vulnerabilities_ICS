The "Vulnerability Bulletin Scraper" project is a Python script designed to extract security bulletins from a specified URL.
It utilizes web scraping techniques to gather information about security vulnerabilities, including their titles,
dates, descriptions, and detail page links. The extracted data can then be filtered based on keywords and exported
to a CSV file for further analysis. Additionally, the script can send email notifications about the latest
vulnerabilities matching certain criteria. This tool is useful for monitoring security bulletins and staying 

informed about potential risks.
